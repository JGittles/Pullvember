day 1: the prologue

This entry starts the first day of Pullvember, a collaborative effort with my bud Sushant to get good at c++ and other robotics subjects.
For today I just made a simple hello world script and am watching Cyrill Stachniss videos on youtube. In additon I have also started digging through
the COSTAR DARPA Subterranian paper to get some learning on for robust SLAM methods.

I'm looking to get progressivly more advanced and slowly incorportate leetcode questions (both reading answers and writing my own).

Hoping I stick with it.
